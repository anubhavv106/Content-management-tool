            Today, the full stack developers are in high demand in the software development industry. Full-stack developers understand all aspects of the development process including the front end and back end sides of the application. Hiring full stack developers reduce the need to hire various resources for product development. In this article, we have explained the concept of full stack development.
          </p>

          <h2>Full Stack Development</h2>

          <p>
          Full Stack development is classified into two domains:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Front-end development :</strong> Front-end development consists of the entire user-facing parts of software development. It is the responsibility of the front-end developers to implement visual elements, for example, how the software or an app will look, interact and operate with the user.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Back-end development :</strong> Back-end development is done to make a program function well. Developers who work at the back-end spend a lot of time creating and working with databases. 
          </p>

          <p>
            A full stack developer is proficient in both the technical domains. Also, they know how to work on front-end, back-end, database queries and various operating systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            Such high-skilled developers are recognized as “developer generalists” as they can develop any complex application from scratch and understand how each technical layer interacts with the other.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Front-end Technologies :-</strong>
          </p>
