            The goal of any first interview is to stand out: to stand out from other interviewed candidates, to stand out as someone who could be exceptional in the role, and to stand out as someone the interviewing team will want to work with.
          </p>

          <h2>First Interview Tips</h2>

         <p> The single best way you can differentiate yourself in the eyes of an interviewer is if you can show them that, A: you understand exactly what they’re looking for right away, and B: you’re ready and willing to provide it right now. And all it takes to show them both is a little research.</p>

<p>In their insightful conversation recorded for the LinkedIn Learning course on How to Rock an Interview, host Pete Mockaitis and Big Interview founder Pam Skillings sketched out how to pull off this pre-interview research perfectly through a clear four-step process:</p> 

<p><strong>Read up on the organization and role online :</strong> “Besides going to the About Us page, you'll also want to check out relevant information targeted for the job that you're specifically interviewing for.”</p>
<p><strong>Catch up on the latest company news :</strong> “Find out interesting news updates that might be relevant to your job and that might impact the work that you specifically do for the company.”</p>

<p> 
<strong>Reach out to connections on LinkedIn :</strong> “Look up people who work or worked at the company who you’re connected with, just to chat and get any insider's tips that will help you in the interview.”<p>

<p>
<strong>Check out the company’s social media :</strong> Brand social media accounts across various channels “can give you an inside look into the company's culture and what's important to them.” </p>


<p><strong>Prepare speaking points (but not a script) :-</strong></p>
</p>Instead of focusing on anticipating and answering your interviewer’s questions with what you think they want to hear, prepare a list of what you want to talk about. “I'm a big believer in this idea of the bullet point approach,” Skillings told Mockaitis. “You’re not scripting word for word, but focusing on the most interesting, relevant things you have to say.”</p>

<p>During the interview, you are making an argument for yourself as right for the role. Your bullet points are your strongest arguments — your “whys.” Why you? Why this company? Why this role? Figure out your whys, make them bullet points, and then try to weave them as naturally as possible into each of your answers during the interview.</p> 

<p>This simple step can differentiate you from scores of applicants who are less thoughtful and prepared.</p>

<strong><i>Transform generic first interview questions into opportunities</i></strong>
<p>Just because you’re not scripting doesn’t mean you can’t plan and prep for specific interview questions. There are a few questions you can pretty safely assume you’re going to hear. </p>

<p>For example, how many times have you been asked, “What is your greatest strength/weakness” in a first interview? </p>

<p>Once you have your speaking points mapped out, you can transform your thinking about questions like these. Remember, every question, including the generic first-interview questions like this one, is an opportunity for you to incorporate your speaking points and show interviewers your personality.</p> 

<p>Learning to “transform” first interview questions like this takes some practice. In their course on Expert Tips for Answering Common Interview Questions, Jenny Foss, Gene Finley, and Linda Raynier provide excellent examples: </p>

<strong>Tell me about yourself :-</strong>
<p>Highlight skills listed in the job description: “Pick a couple of skills in the job description and brainstorm how you can describe yourself as a person while also showcasing your strengths in those skills the employer is seeking.”</p>





<p>Humanize it with a story: “People love a good story, so don’t be afraid to weave in some personality and human interest as you respond.”</p>
<strong>What is your greatest strength?</strong> 
<p>Provide an example by sharing an experience: “If you’re applying for a sales job, for example, then tell a story about a time when your strength helped a customer solve a problem.”</p>

<p>Specifically, connect your strength to the required skills: “I want you to use soft and technical skills to tell your story. If your strength is effective communication, for example, tell them about a time when you used that effective communication to have a conversation with an executive.”</p>

<strong>Why do you want to work here?</strong>
<p>Make it about them first: “Show that you’ve done your research and thought through what you can contribute to their team first.”</p>
<p>
Weave your answer into what you can contribute: “For instance, you could speak to how the role will help you combine your professional skills with your passions.”</p>

<strong>Show enthusiasm for the role, not just the company</strong>
<p>“When it comes down to it, your success in this position is going to depend on the job itself,” Skillings said. “Talk about how this job description is made for you. Speak to the job description and both the fact that you are a great fit for it and also that you would be excited about it.”</p>

<p>When you’re creating your “why” bullet points, make sure you’re focusing on the role itself, not just the company. Don’t be afraid to base your bullet points on the professional hard and soft skills that the job description mentions directly. You could explicitly reference those skills during the interview itself. </p>

<strong>Close out by asking some impressive questions of your own </strong>
</p>At the end of the first interview, you are usually going to be asked, “Do you have any questions for me?” “This question is your test,” reminded Foss. “They want to see if you’re engaged, intelligent, and interested in the job.”</p>

<p>Luckily, this “test” is also your opportunity to end the interview on a high note. It’s all about the questions you ask. Foss provided a few strong ones to consider:</p>

<p>Questions that show you’ve been paying attention: “Jot down a few notes as the interview unfolds and then loop back to something you’d like to delve further into, like an aspect of the job, the team, or challenges that lay ahead.”</p>
<p>
Questions that show you’re genuinely excited: “Consider asking a question about one of your favorite products or see how they’re responding to an industry trend, for instance.”</p>
<p>
Questions that get the interviewer talking about their careers: “People appreciate when you notice the interesting things they’re doing and they love talking about themselves.”</p>
